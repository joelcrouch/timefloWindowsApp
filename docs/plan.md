## Resources

In order to execute this program you will at least need:

- A functioning Windows Computer running Windows 10.

- A copy of the executable file

In order to perform work on this program you will need the above resources and:

- A development workspace such as Vim or Visual Studios

- The programming language is C++

- A copy or branch of the source code

- [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/)

## Work Breakdown

- Establish a program window using the windows development library. 2-3 hours. The entire program is dependant on having a window to display the program.

- The window will need various buttons for starting the timer, pausing the timer, canceling the timer, and saving user settings. The program window will also need a slider to represent the timers. Putting these on the program window will take 1 hour or less. Making the buttons function as intended will depend on various other parts of the program. 

- The timer will need to internally count to its max value. This should take 1-2 hours in order to properly reflect the timer's progress in the program window.

- The program will notify the user through Windows' notification system as well as a sound. This should take 2 hours or less.

- The program will need to save the user's settings, the max times for both work and break periods. It should initialize these settings on program startup. This should take less than 2 hours.

| Completion of "The program functions" Milestone | 10/31/21

## Milestones and Deliverables

This section will outline the milestones of the program. These are the major tangible progress markers as program implementation comes to completion. The first milestone will show the completion of the program window. The second and final milestone will show the completion of the functional program.

### *Milestone/Deliverable 1*

*The program window*

This milestone involves the main visual component of the program, completing the program window. This milestone must be completed first otherwise testing the functionality of the program will be difficult or in some cases pointless. When this milestone is complete the program will visually appear finished, with buttons and sliders, however none of the actual function of the program will be complete at this time.

### *Milestone/Deliverable 2*

*The program functions*

This milestone refers to the complete implementation of the program's functions. This milestone will cover the program's ability to count time, notify the user that the count is complete, and saving user settings. After this milestone is complete the program will be functionally complete. Small changes may be made or extra features may be added at this point if time allows. After this, the program will be validated and verified, then turned in for credit.

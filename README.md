# TimeFlo
Copyright &copy; 2021 *Jordan Hyde*

TimeFlo is an implementation of a
[Pomodoro&reg;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)-like
timer for breaking out of flow state.

This timer will run on windows, it will save user preferences, and will feature a slider timer display that can be moved while the timer is running.

## Status and Roadmap

Current Status: Implementation!

Todo:

- validation and verification

* [x] Requirements complete.
* [x] Project plan complete.
* [x] Design complete.
* [x] Implementation complete.
* [ ] Validation complete.

## Build and Run

Run Instructions:
* Run project on Windows system only
* Run .exe file from [TimeFlo/RUNNABLE .EXE FILE(up to date)](https://gitlab.cecs.pdx.edu/foxdev/timeflo-windows-team-a/-/blob/main/RUNNABLE%20.EXE%20FILE%20(up%20to%20date)/TimeFlo_Project.exe)
* After downloading TimeFlo, select the downloaded folder.  A new window will open. There are two 
  time periods one may choose to use: work and break periods. The work period is used for the amount 
  of time used on the productive time, and the break time is the amount of time used for a break time.
  Use the slider to choose a time beneath their respective time periods, or choose a specific time 
  to the right.  Minutes, seconds, and hours may be selected for the work or rest periods, if the 
  specific time option is used.
  After the time has completed, a bell and a pop-up will alert the user to the end of the time period.
  The user may opt to use the same time again, if necessary. 

Build Instructions:
* Add project via HTTPS to visual studios or other windows IDE
* Build [Timeflo Project.cpp ](https://gitlab.cecs.pdx.edu/jordhyde/TimeFlo/-/blob/main/Application/TimeFlo%20Project/TimeFlo%20Project/TimeFlo%20Project.cpp)
